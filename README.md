### Professional Experience
* Capstone Project: ML, Brain Tumors & MRI
  * Trained a publicly available Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain image dataset with 3 different pre-trained CNN models with Keras to accurately predict 3 types of brain tumor (chosen model’s accuracy is 92%); created a retrieval-augmented question-answer model using Langchain and Pinecone to answer questions relating to MRI safety with demonstration on Streamlit
  * [Check the project out]((https://github.com/constancelinwf/ga_projects/tree/main/brain_tumor_prediction)


* Project 4 - Social Impact
* A job-role recommender system based on (introverted) MBTI personality traits - brought to you by The Burnt-Out Bunnies
  * Created a proof-of-concept job matching system where a user can input text data and an MBTI label will be derived along with a job role recommendation – the chosen NLP-trained MBTI trait classifier models had an accuracy of at least 79%

•	Built an NLP classifier model with 85% accuracy to classify if a user is a coffee or tea drinker based on the user’s input text with demonstration on Streamlit

•	Exhibited experience in using predictive modelling algorithms (Logistic Regression with Regularization techniques) to predict resale prices of Singapore’s HDB flats

•	Successfully predicted trends in Dengue fever cases through data collection, data extraction and accurate analysis of Singapore’s weather using matplotlib and seaborn libraries

•	Consistently produced diagnostic quality MRI brain and body images well within the required timeline of 2 years for about 500 7-year-old participants in GUSTO study in 2022
