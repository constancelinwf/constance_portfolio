## Projects
<b>Capstone Project: ML, Brain Tumors & MRI</b>
  * Trained a publicly available Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain image dataset with 3 different pre-trained CNN models with Keras to accurately predict 3 types of brain tumor (chosen model’s accuracy is 92%); created a retrieval-augmented question-answer model using Langchain and Pinecone to answer questions relating to MRI safety with demonstration on Streamlit

<b>Social impact Project: A job-role recommender system based on (introverted) MBTI personality traits</b>
* Created a proof-of-concept job matching system where a user can input text data and an MBTI label will be derived along with a job role recommendation
* The chosen NLP-trained MBTI trait classifier models had an accuracy of at least 79%
 * Each trait is a binary classification and the best model for that trait is chosen on accuracy score

<b>DPRC Pte Ltd: Doubleshot Peaberry Republic of Coffee vs Decaf Pu-Erh Republic of Cha</b>
* Inspiration came from online personality quizzes that our team members have done
* Put into practice web scrapping techniques and natural language processing (NLP) techniques learnt
* Built an NLP classifier model with 85% accuracy to classify if a user is a coffee or tea drinker based on the user’s input text with demonstration on Streamlit

<b>Singapore Housing Modelling</b>
* Made use of using predictive modelling algorithms such as Logistic Regression with Regularization techniques to predict resale prices of Singapore’s HDB flats

<b>Weather & Dengue</b>
* Project focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Predicted trends in Dengue fever cases through data collection, data extraction and accurate analysis of Singapore’s weather using matplotlib and seaborn libraries
